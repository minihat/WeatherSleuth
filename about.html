<p>Tim Hall is an executive at The Aerospace Corporation and a military veteran having retired as a Lt
	 Col from the Air Force Reserve in 2013. He has been a consultant in forensic meteorology since 2009.
	  Following his commissioning through AF ROTC in May 1992, Tim entered active duty as a weather officer
		 in Jan 1993. His military assignments ranged from operational weather forecasting to acquisition program
		 management. From 2000 to 2003 he served as Officer-in-Charge of the Joint Presidential Weather Support Unit,
		 directing a team that provided global forecast services to the White House Military Office and Marine One.
		  In 2006, he transitioned to the Air Force Reserve and was hired as a project engineer by The Aerospace
			Corporation. Currently, he serves as Principle Director of Aerospace's NOAA Programs Directorate. In this
			executive position, he leads a team of more than 40 engineers and scientists responsible to provide expert
			technical advice and assistance to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). His group's
			 primary charge is to support NOAA senior executives involved in procurement of the next generation of weather
			  satellites. </p>



<p>Tim Hall's expertise includes applied climatology, forensic meteorology, satellite meteorology, weather
	analysis and forecasting, predictive data analytics, weather risk management, and systems architecture.
	He holds a B.S. in Meteorology (1992) from The Pennsylvania State University, and a M.S. in Atmospheric
	Science (1997) from Colorado State University.  He is an active member of The American Meteorological Society
	(AMS), The National Weather Association (NWA), and National Council of Industrial Meteorologists (NCIM).
	 He currently serves on the AMS Board for Certified Consulting Meteorologists and was an officer on the
	 National Council of Industrial Meteorologists (NCIM) Board of Directors from 2012-2015. From 2010 to 2013,
	 Tim served on the AMS Board for Private Sector Meteorologists. In 2013 he was the private sector
	 representative on AMS's ad hoc committee chartered to update the AMS's policy on full and open access to
	 environmental data.  He has presented technical papers and hosted sessions at numerous conferences. In
	  January 2013, he organized and co-chaired several sessions of the AMS' Third Conference on Research
		Transition to Operations. Tim earned his CCM (#641) in February 2008. </p>



<p>Since 1957, the <a href="https://www.ametsoc.org/ams/">American Meteorological Society</a> (AMS) has awarded the designation of Certified Consulting
	Meteorologist (<a href="https://www.ametsoc.org/ams/index.cfm/education-careers/ams-professional-certification-programs/?utm_source=brochures&utm_medium=print&utm_campaign=Certifications">CCM</a>) to individuals who have demonstrated to a Board of their peers that they possess the
	technical knowledge, experience, and character to professionally and competently serve the
	public as meteorological subject matter experts. The primary purpose of the program is to enable
	users of meteorological services to select consultants with the confidence that they will receive high
	quality, authoritative and ethical professional counsel.</p>



	<p>The CCM program is a public service administered by the AMS. The essential attributes of a CCM are
		 a specialized knowledge combined a broad background, an ingrained concept of service, and a clear and
		 unwavering adherence to the rules of professional conduct. The program includes a mandatory continued
		  professional development component to ensure that active CCMs maintain currency in the rapidly evolving

			disciplines of the atmospheric sciences.</p>


<p>In his spare time Tim is a storm spotter for the National Weather Service through its Skywarn
	program and provides precipitation observations as part of the Community Collaborative Rain,
	Hail & Snow (CoCoRAHS) Network.  He is also a crooner and avid fencer specializing in epee.  </p>
