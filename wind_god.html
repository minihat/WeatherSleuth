<h4 style="text-align:center"><em>The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails.</em>
	-William Arthur Ward</h4>
<p>Before science enabled us to understand the phenomena of earth's environment, humankind
	struggled to explain the uncontrollable, magical, terrible, wondrous, destructive, sustaining,
	frightening, chaotic and often seemingly random forces of nature. While rain was often associated with life
	 and fertility, thunderstorms were associated with power and might. Thunder and lightning were the domain of the
	  most powerful sky gods such as the familiar Greek god <em>Zeus</em>, the Sumerian <em>Ishkur</em> and the Finnish <em>Ukko</em>.
		The wind was viewed by many ancient and native peoples as the work of fickle powers and understood to be the
		harbinger of change --- for good and ill.</p>

<p>Many civilizations worshipped wind deities --- often with separate gods and goddesses for each
	 cardinal direction. In Greek mythology, the <em>Anemoi</em>, or the Winds, were the four sons of the dawn goddess,
	  <em>Eos</em>, and the god of dusk, <em>Astraeu</em>.  <em>Boreas</em> was the Greek god of the north wind called the cold breadth of
		winter while <em>Notus</em> was the Greek god of the south wind known as the god of summer rain storms. <em>Zephyrus</em>,
		the gentle west wind, was the most benevolent of the four and the only one that featured prominently in
		myth. <em>Eurus</em> was the Greek god of the east wind.</p>

<img id="in_art_image" src="images/Fujin.jpg" alt="Fujin" height=350 width=70% style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px">

<p>Many early civilizations similarly honored spirits or worshipped gods and goddesses of wind.
	  <em>Da-jo-ji</em> was the Native American (Iroquois) mighty panther spirit of the west wind.
		<em>Tilocayoti</em> was the Aztec god of the east wind. <em>Bieggolmai</em> was the unpredictable Sami god of the
		summer winds and storms who used two shovels to shuffle the winds into and out of his cave.
		<em>Feng Popo</em> ("madam wind") was the Chinese goddess of the wind. She is usually depicted as an old
		woman riding through the clouds on the back of a tiger. The Greek god <em>Aeolus</em> was considered king
		of the winds. Since the winds were conceived of as horse-shaped spirits, <em>Aeolus</em> was titled <em>Hippotades</em>,
		"the reiner of horses," from the Greek <em>hippos</em> ("horse") and <em>taden</em> ("reined in tightly").  The Egyptian
		and Berber god of creation and the wind was <em>Amun</em>. The name of the pharaoh Tutankhamun (aka "King Tut")
		translates to, "the living image of <em>Amun</em>."</p>

<p>Some of the historical names of the wind deities have carried on into modernity and remains part
	of our 21st century lexicon.  <em>Habagat</em> is the Philippine god of winds and rain who rules the kingdom of
	silver and gold in the sky. Contemporary use of the term in the Philippines refers to a weather system
	that is composed of warm and humid winds moving in a southwest direction associated with monsoon rains.
	 <em>Huracan</em> was the Mayan god of wind, storms and fire and is considered to be the possible source of the word
	 hurricane.</p>
