<div id="story_box">
<p>On February 7-8, 1904, the heart of Baltimore was scorched by a wind-driven conflagration of horrific magnitude.
   It remains the third largest urban mass fire in U.S. History topped only by the San Francisco Fire and Earthquake of 1906 and
   Great Chicago Fire of 1871. This is the story of the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904 as told through the retrospective eyes of a
   forensic meteorologist.</p>

<p>A lookback published in Baltimore's <i>Sun Magazine</i> in February 1948 captured the moments leading up to the fateful,
  silent alarm at the J.E. Hurst & Company Building - in the proverbial calm before the storm preceding 32 hours of
  hell for Baltimore's business district:</p>

<i>
  <p>"As church bells pealed on that cloudy, blustery Sunday morning of Feb. 7, 1904, Baltimore women were on the way
    to services held in their elegant broad-brimmed hats, loosely perched atop pompadours. The southwest wind tugged at
    their full sweeping skirts, permitting glimpses of high-button shoes and cotton stockings.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption style="text-align: center">Figure 1. Baltimore and Chase St., c. 1900.</figcaption>
</figure>
  <p>Mustachioed men in high winged collars - some of freshly scrubbed celluloid - clutched their derbies, too, as they
    squired the women across cobble-stoned streets, keeping a wary eye on the horses and carriages.</p>

  <p>The brisk wind on an otherwise quiet Sunday morning in Baltimore sang in the maze of telephone and telegraph wires
    strung on wooden poles above the streets, and it had been humming and moaning most of the night before at the windows
    and doors of houses. But no one had detected any omen of disaster in its eerie cry.</p>

  <p>There had been the usual leisurely Sunday breakfasts of kidney stew and waffles - and the Sunday papers. War between Russia and Japan seemed certain.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/Fig_2_Picture2.png" alt="Baltimore St., c. 1900" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; height: 55%; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px">
<figcaption style="text-align: center">Figure 2. Baltimore St., c. 1900.</figcaption>
</figure>
  <p>But the news faded into the background at church amid the sermons and hymns and the swish of petticoats as congregations knelt,
    stood or sat in accord with ritual. A little before 11 o'clock, citizens in downtown attending church and other business heard the
    distant clang of fire-engine bells... a few minutes later a terrific explosion jarred windows, and then there was a scuffle of people
    running into the streets mingled with the gallop of fire horses. Bells and sirens sounded in all directions.</p>

  <p>And when, as services ended and people poured into the streets, they saw great flames billowing in a pall of black smoke over Hopkins place."</p>

<i><figcaption style="text-align: center">Figure 3. Four views of the J.E. Hurst Building and surrounding area before, during after the fire.</figcaption>
</i></figure>
<p>Propelled by the wind, the fire that ignited at Hopkins Place in the Hurst Building grew into a dangerous conflagration that burned steadily in
  full volume for 32 hours - not declared under control until 5:00 p.m., Monday Feb. 8.  Note that all times through this article are Eastern Standard Time (EST). The photo on the upper left of Fig. 3
  shows the Hurst Building before the fire, circa 1900.  The image on the lower left was taken about 15 minutes after the initial alarm.
  On the upper right we catch a 3:00 p.m. view of the spreading and intensifying fire in the vicinity of the Hurst Building from an elevated
  vantage point about a half mile to the east. Note from this perspective the clear slant to the right reflecting the effect of the strong southwesterly
  wind carrying smoke, ash and hot embers to the northeast (moving left to right in the photo). The photo on the lower right was taken in the aftermath on Monday, Feb. 8
  even while the fire still raged a
  mile to the east.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, Feb. 8, the fire dominated the headlines around the nation (Fig. 4). In the early storyline the event was already
  being pegged as one of the most horrific conflagrations in American History. By 5:00 p.m., 1,526 buildings housing 2,500 businesses
  were destroyed (Fig. 5) putting 35,000 people out of work and causing a reported $150 million in damage, which equates to over $4
  Billion in 2018 U.S. dollars. Incredibly, there were only 5 fatalities related to the fire.</p>

<p>About five years ago, I visited the Fire Museum of Maryland in Lutherville outside of Baltimore where there is an extensive,
  interactive exhibit chronicling this event.  What fascinated me about the story were countless references to the wind conditions
  that frustrated efforts to get this blaze under control - and the absence of an authoritative meteorological analysis. So, I decided
  to conduct a forensic meteorological investigation.</p>

<p>As I sifted through the historical data and on-the-scene reports, a rich weather story emerged involving a range of synoptic to
  microscale meteorological phenomena featuring dramatically shifting conditions over the course of the 32-hour event. Along the
  way I discovered lesser known anecdotes that will interest weather enthusiasts.</p>
