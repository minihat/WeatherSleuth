<b><p>Meteorological Analysis, Feb. 2-8, 1904</p></b>
<p>
The historical map below (Fig. 6) reflects Baltimore in the early 1900s. The picture of
Baltimore's downtown skyline (lower left) was taken in 1903 from Federal Hill, situated
to the southwest across Baltimore's Inner Harbor. Over the course of 32 hours on Feb.
7-8, 1904, 140 acres marked by the shaded area in the photo were obliterated. This area
subsequently became known as the "Burned District."
</p>
<p>
Helpful to this forensic analysis, there was a U.S. Weather Bureau Office (WBO) about
0.4 miles from the northwest edge of the fire zone at 532 W. Howard St. (<b>X</b>, Fig. 6). This
weather station, on the property of John's Hopkins University, housed a full suite of
early 1900s automated weather observing equipment. It carried the moniker "Baltimore
Customs House." To acquire historical records for a weather reconstruction and
analysis, my first task was to request historical data from the archive National Center
for Environmental Information (NCEI) in Asheville, NC. My second task involved a
visit to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Library in
Silver Spring, MD to study the large form, U.S. Department of Agriculture Daily
Weather Maps for early February, 1904 [2].

</figure>
<p>
As a primary U.S. WBO, the Baltimore Customs House station was equipped with a
Robinson Anemometer mounted on a mast with the weather vane (Fig. 7) sited on the
station's roof. Standards published in the Anemometry Guide [3] of the U.S. Weather
Bureau specify that the "position selected for exposure of the vane should be as
unobstructed as possible by chimneys, domes, ventilators, towers, or adjacent
buildings, or other objects that may interfere with the movement of the wind." For the
Baltimore Customs House station in 1904, the anemometer height was 117 feet above
ground (230 feet above sea level) representing an above roof-top wind.
</p>
<p>
A Triple Register (Fig. 7) recorded the wind velocity, wind direction, rain, and
sunshine, with output recorded on a meteorgraph. Wind observations represented a 5-
minute average (sustained wind) for winds 12 knots or greater. Winds less than 12
knots represented an average over an increasing time interval (greater than 5 minutes)
as speed approached calm conditions. Observations were taken on a regular hourly
schedule and logged on a Weather Bureau Form 1001B. Direction was reported to the
eight primary compass points (N, NE, E, SW, etc.). Significant changes in weather
conditions including wind speed and direction at any time of day were recorded in a
daily Weather Bureau Journal. 12-hour peak wind speed and direction were also
recorded along with other parameters twice daily (at approximately 8:00 a.m. and 8:00
p.m.) on Form 1001-Met'l, Original Monthly Record of Observations.

<p>
On Feb. 2-3, 1904 (5-6 days prior to the conflagration), a strong cold front ushered in
arctic air, plunging temperatures in the mid-Atlantic region into the teens. A
temperature of 16&#8457; was reported at the Baltimore Customs House at 8:00 a.m. on Feb.
3. On Feb. 4, high pressure moved into the region sparking a cold-air damming event
8
that featured a shallow wedge of frigid air spilling down the eastern edge of the
Appalachian Mountains from Pennsylvania southward to North Carolina. The
temperature at 8:00 a.m. on Feb. 4 in Baltimore was 17&#8457; and topped out in the mid-20s
(&#8457;) during the day as the barometric pressure continued to rise. On Feb. 5 the center of
high pressure slid southeast toward the Atlantic coast and arctic air nosed its way into
Georgia overnight Feb. 4 into the morning of Feb. 5. Throughout the day on Feb. 5,
high pressure weakened as broad, warm southerly flow developed over the eastern U.S.

annotation of weather fronts and pressure centers. Note that the broken blue line on the
Monday, Feb 8 map represents the location of the high pressure ridge.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
By 8:00 p.m. on Feb. 5, high pressure moved off the southeast coast putting the eastern
seaboard of the U.S. into a warm southerly flow which scoured out all remnants of the
arctic outbreak. At 8:00 p.m. on Feb. 6, the Baltimore WBO reported a temperature of
50&#8457;. From the night of Feb.6 into the morning of Feb. 7, another low pressure system
moved out of the west into Michigan's Upper Peninsula. As I have analyzed it on the
map in Fig. 8, a trailing cold front snaked through the Mississippi Valley, poised to
pounce on the U.S. east coast with yet another cold air outbreak. Between 7:00 and 8:00
p.m. on Sunday, Feb. 7, the front passed with hardly a trace of precipitation through the
mid-Atlantic but brought with it brisk winds and falling temperatures as a high
pressure ridge built in. This fast-moving frontal system followed by building high
pressure were the large-scale (i.e., synoptic) features that created strong, gusty winds
with shifting direction, driving the evolution of the Baltimore Fire.
</p>
<p>
The meteogram (Fig. 9) represents the local conditions in Baltimore on Feb. 7-8. The
solid blue line is temperature (&#8457;) while the green line is barometric pressure (inches).
Wind barbs (knots) are depicted every two hours along the bottom of the chart starting
with the first wind observation plotted at 10:00 a.m. on the far left. Gusts were
estimated following Durst, 1960 [4]. To reconstruct these data, I primarily relied on two
operational weather stations, the Baltimore Customs House and the U.S. Naval
Observatory (USNO) in Washington, D.C. A data table with additional information is
shown in the Appendix. I did not adjust the 3-hourly barometric readings from the
USNO to expected station pressure for Baltimore. The purpose of analyzing the
pressure data was to identify changes over time representing the pressure trend for
Baltimore in this situation. I cross-compared these primary data with observations from
additional stations in the region including the Washington, D.C. WBO and cooperative
weather observation stations in Frederick, MD, Annapolis, MD and Prince
Fredericktown, MD. NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)
provided the historical surface observational data from their official archive.
</p>
<p>
Overnight from Feb. 6 into Feb. 7, clear skies and calm winds provided conditions
conducive for formation of a shallow, surface-based radiation inversion (inferred from
the observational data) which cut off the surface layer of the atmosphere from the
prevailing southerly flow aloft above the city and allowed the temperature to drop
overnight. With a surface based radiation inversion, temperature increases with height
from a minimum at the surface through a layer of about 300 feet on average. They
typically form at night under clear, calm conditions. At 9:00 a.m. on Feb. 7 the
temperature bottomed out at 39&#8457; and light fog was observed. Fog is consistent with the
presence of a radiation inversion allowing the temperature to fall to the dew point
under calm winds and the relative humidity to increase to near 100%. At 10:15 a.m., the
radiation inversion broke as radiation from the sun heated the surface and lower levels
of the atmosphere, allowing southerly flow aloft which had continued to increase
overnight (but was cut off from the lower levels by the inversion) to mix down to the
surface. This is evidenced by the sudden increase of winds observed at the Baltimore
WBO at 10:15 a.m. from calm to 10 knots from the southwest at 117 feet above ground.
Tragedies often result from an coincidence of unfortunate circumstances and that was
true of the Baltimore fire. If the 10:45 a.m. fire alarm in the Hurst Building had sounded
a couple of hours earlier while calm conditions prevailed under the atmospheric
temperature inversion, this tragic conflagration might have been contained by first
responders before it could spread.

<figcaption style="text-align: center">Meteogram representing reconstructed weather conditions in Baltimore area on
Feb. 7-8, 1904. Surface temperature and average wind above rooftop level from Baltimore
Customs House, surface pressure from U.S. Naval Observatory, Washington, D.C. The three
phases of the fire shown just below the x-axis are described in the text of the article. Select
observations associated with the highest wind gusts are shown in boxes near the wind barbs
in the format NNGnnKT where NN is sustained wind speed, G means gust, nn is the
estimated gust and KT stands for knots. The wind barbs depict the direction from which the
wind is blowing (based on standard compass headings) with a long barb representing a
value of 10 knots and a half barb 5 knots. A long barb with a short barb is 15 knots while two
long barbs means 20 knots and so on. </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
On Sunday, Feb. 7 from 10:00 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., winds were stiff out of the southwest
with a peak of 17 knots gusting to 24 knots at noon. Prevailing conditions through the
period were 12-15 knots gusting 18-21 knots. Using the power law to estimate winds
closer to the surface at a standard, modern measurement height of 33 feet (or 10 meters),
and assuming the frictional characteristics of an urban regime, I estimate that
corresponding near surface winds were 10 knots gusting to 15 knots.
</p>
<p>
Based on the wind shift from southwesterly to westerly, the sudden change in the
pressure tendency from decreasing to increasing, and the temperature trend, I
determine with a high degree of certainty that the cold front analyzed to the west on the
8:00 a.m., Feb. 7 Daily Weather Map passed through Baltimore at about 7:30 p.m., Feb.
7. This event is marked by the blue triangle labeled "COLD FROPA" in the meteogram
(Fig. 9). I estimate that around 2:00 p.m. on Monday, Feb. 8, the temperature fell below
32&#8457; consistent with the temperature readings at the USNO station in Washington, D.C.
at 12:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m., and the Baltimore WBO observation of 28&#8457; at 8:00 p.m. Not
shown Fig. 9 is that the relative humidity also would have plummeted following frontal
passage which created even more favorable incendiary conditions
</p>
<p>
As often occurs following passage of a cold front in this region, the winds shifted to
northwesterly several hours after frontal passage as cold air started to pour into the city.
Prevailing conditions from near midnight on Feb. 7 though the afternoon of the Feb. 8
were sustained northwest winds at 12-18 knots with estimated gusts 18-24 knots.
Behind the front, winds shifted to westerly and stiffened with a peak of 22 knots
gusting to 30 knots (35 miles per hour) at 11:00 p.m. The absolute maximum wind
during the event was northwest at 26 knots gusting to an estimated 36 knots (41 miles
per hour) on Feb. 7 at 11:40 p.m. At 10:00 a.m., Feb. 8 winds remained strong with an
estimated 32 knot gust (37 miles per hour). Such post-frontal conditions are not unusual
for the mid-Atlantic region in winter. However on Feb. 7-8, the stiff winds wreaked
havoc on Baltimore.
